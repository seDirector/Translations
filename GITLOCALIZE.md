# Translation Info

GitHub page: [https://github.com/seDirector/Translations](https://github.com/seDirector/Translations)

Note: this page may show "Translated 100%" but that is because of the machine auto translation. The current language status is listed on the GitHub page.

1.  Click any of the languages. If you don't see your language above click "Add Language" on GitLocalize.
2.  Type the translation on the right side of the page and click "Submit".
3.  When you are ready to submit the translation for review, click "Create Review Request" at the top. Type a comment (optional) and click "Submit". Then click "Send Pull Request", give it a title, and click "Submit Pull Request".
4.  Once a translation file has enough of the main translations done, it will be merged into seDirector.
5.  Updates to language files on the repo will continue to be updated in seDirector in future versions.
6.  Once merged into seDirector, your username will be mentioned in seDirector as a contributor AND you'll receive a free contributor license.

# Rules to Follow

1.  Do not translate if you don't read and write the language.
2.  If you see HTML tags, please do not change/remove the HTML tags, just replace words/phrases as needed.
3.  Keep the case the same - if it's capitalized, capitalize the translation, if there is a period, use a period in the translation, if it has a comma, use commas, etc.
4.  There may be duplicate translations - please keep them.
5.  When you see a number in braces, that is a tag that means a variable will go there. Keep the `{0}` or `{1}` tags in the translation. As long as the meaning is the same, you can move them as needed.
6.  `{LB}` means line break - please keep existing line breaks and double line breaks.
