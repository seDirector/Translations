If you can read/write in any of these languages OR if you have another language you'd like to contribute, we'd love your help translating seDirector.

**Note**: the GitLocalize page may show **Translated 100%** but that is because of the **automatic machine translation**. The table below reflects the current status of language translation.

# 4. Rules to Follow

1.  Do not translate if you don't read and write the language.
2.  If you see HTML tags, please do **not** change/remove the HTML tags, just replace words/phrases as needed.
3.  Keep the case the same - if it's capitalized, capitalize the translation, if there is a period, use a period in the translation, if it has a comma, use a comma, etc.
4.  There may be duplicate translations - please keep them.
5.  When you see a number in braces, that is a tag that means a variable will go there. Keep the `{0}` or `{1}` tags in the translation. As long as the meaning is the same, you can move them as needed.
6.  `{LB}` means line break - please keep existing line breaks and double line breaks.
