# Language Status

If you can read/write in any of these languages OR if you have another language you'd like to contribute, we'd love your help translating seDirector.

**Note**: the GitLocalize page may show **Translated 100%** but that is because of the **automatic machine translation**. The table below reflects the current status of language translation.

Many of the strings can be translated automatically, but we do need help with the more complex strings, and to confirm that the automatic translations are correct.

# Getting Started

1. Join the **#translations** channel on Discord by messaging a mod on our [Discord](https://sedirector.net/discord) server. This will enable you to chat with other translators, ask questions, and receive beta versions to test your translations. As we work on different features, there might be times when we're not set up to introduce _new_ languages.
2. [Visit the GitLocalize project](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6994) or click any of the languages above.
3. Type the translation on the right side of the page and click **Submit**.
4. When you are ready to submit the translation for review:
    1. Click **Create Review Request** at the top.
    2. Type a comment (optional) and click **Submit**.
    3. Click **Send Pull Request**, give it a title, and click **Submit Pull Request**.
5. Once a translation file has enough of the main translations done, it will be merged into seDirector.
6. Updates to language files on the repo will continue to be updated in seDirector in future versions.

Some of the HTML strings can be daunting. You can use a tool like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sceditor.com/">SCEditor</a> to visualize the HTML and make it easier to edit. Just click the "view source" button and paste the English HTML string into it, then click it again to see the HTML version. After editing, click the "view source" button again and copy the HTML back into GitLocalize. Please make sure the HTML tags still match what the English string shows. Thank you!

# Rules to Follow

1.  Please only translate if you read and write the language fluently.
2.  If you see HTML tags, please do **not** change/remove the HTML tags, just replace words/phrases as needed.
3.  Keep the case the same - if it's capitalized, capitalize the translation, if there is a period, use a period in the translation, if it has a comma, use a comma, etc.
4.  There may be duplicate translations - please keep them.
5.  When you see a number in braces, that is a tag that means a variable will go there. Keep the `{0}` or `{1}` tags in the translation. As long as the meaning is the same, you can move them as needed.
6.  `{LB}` means line break - please keep existing line breaks and double line breaks.
7.  For strings related to the API, please keep the URLs the same. For example, `/update/4` should be kept `/update/4` and NOT translated.
