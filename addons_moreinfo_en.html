<h3>Most Games: Metamod:Source, Metamod:Source 2, SourceMod, CounterStrikeSharp</h3>

<p>
    seDirector supports installing, upgrading, downgrading, reinstalling, and removing addons. seDirector is smart when changing the addons;
    it will only install the files necessary to change the versions - it will not remove your config files or plugins.
</p>

<p>
    If an addon is upgraded, downgraded, or reinstalled, a backup will be made prior to taking any action.
    Look under the <code class="code-style">addons\\[Backups]</code> directory for the backups created by seDirector.
</p>

<p>
    <b>MAKE SURE to test your server</b> after making addon changes.<br>
    To verify <b>Metamod</b> is working, type 'meta version' in console.<br>
    To verify <b>SourceMod</b> is working, type 'sm version' in console.<br>
    To verify <b>CounterStrikeSharp</b> is working, type 'meta list' in console and look for 'CounterStrikeSharp'.<br>
</p>
<p>
    If you receive an error message after an update has been installed/changed, make sure you're using the latest version.
    Older versions may not work properly and cause your server to crash or plugins to malfunction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>SourceMod</b> depends on <b>Metamod:Source</b> to work. Make sure to use a version of <b>SourceMod</b> compatible with your version of <b>Metamod:Source</b>.
    After installing <b>Metamod:Source</b>, the metamod.vdf file is automatically generated specific to your game server.
</p>

<p>
    <b>CounterStrikeSharp</b> depends on <b>Metamod:Source 2</b> to work. Make sure to use a version of <b>CounterStrikeSharp</b> compatible with your version of <b>Metamod:Source 2</b>.
    After installing or removing <b>Metamod:Source 2</b> or <b>CounterStrikeSharp</b>, the gameinfo.gi file is automatically adjusted.
</p>

<h3>Garry's Mod: ULib, ULX, Wiremod</h3>

<p>
    seDirector supports installing and removing ULib, ULX, and Wiremod. Upgrading/downgrading is not supported.
    Most of the update-related features are handled by the scripts themselves, so there probably won't be much of a need to upgrade or downgrade anyway.
</p>

<p>
    <b>MAKE SURE to test your server</b> after making addon changes.
</p>

<p>
    If you already have ULib, ULX, or Wiremod installed and you want seDirector to detect it,
    rename <code class="code-style">\\addons\\ULib-oldname</code> to <code class="code-style">\\addons\\ULib</code>, rename <code class="code-style">\\addons\\ULX-oldname</code> to
    <code class="code-style">\\addons\\ULX</code>, rename <code class="code-style">\\addons\\Wiremod-oldname</code> to <code class="code-style">\\addons\\Wiremod</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>ULX</b> depends on <b>ULib</b> to work. Make sure to use a version of <b>ULX</b> compatible with your version of <b>ULib</b>.
