Look under the addons\\[Backups] directory for the backups created by seDirector.<br /><br /> <b>MAKE SURE to test your server</b> after making addon changes. Type 'meta version' in console to make sure <b>Metamod:Source</b> is working. Type 'sm version' in console to make sure <b>SourceMod</b> is working. If you receive an error message after an update has been installed/changed, make sure you're using the latest version. Older versions may not work properly and cause your server to crash or plugins to malfunction.<br /><br /> <b>SourceMod</b> depends on <b>Metamod:Source</b> to work. Make sure to use a version of <b>SourceMod</b> compatible with your version of <b>Metamod:Source</b>. After installing <b>Metamod:Source</b>, the metamod.vdf file is automatically generated specific to your game server. </p> <h3>Garry's Mod: ULib | ULX | Wiremod</h3> <p> seDirector supports installing and removing ULib, ULX, and Wiremod. Upgrading/downgrading is not supported.
